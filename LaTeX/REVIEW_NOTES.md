# Outline of changes to be made to the paper

- [ ] Fix omissions/errors in 3.1, 3.3, 3.4.
- [ ] Fill out the results section more; Show code output for multiple solutions.
- [ ] Include pseudocode (? - perhaps optional because of the inclusion of the github)
- [ ] Include pennylane.ai citation(?)
- [ ] Dig into comparison with Shor's more; Grover's uses less qubits but may(?) not be faster.
- [ ] **Describe in more depth how Toffoli gates are used for the Oracle.** Example of oracle match and oracle non-match. Oracle's point is to flip the phase of the target state with the Z gate.
- [ ] Make it very clear that the implementation is generalized, and works for any given (non-square) input.
- [ ] Make it clear that we are using QFT arithmetic

- [ ] Describe the experimental set-up in more depth.
- [ ] Results and evaluation need improvement.
- [ ] Check more recent literature to substantiate and benchmark methodologies.

- [ ] Delete a lot of contextual stuff with cryptography- specifically asymmetric difficulty of factoring and multiplication.
- [ ] 3.1: "Three main parts" There are technically five in the diagram, and should be explained.
- [ ] Explain toffoli gates in-depth.

- [ ] Describe where count of necessary # qubits comes from.
